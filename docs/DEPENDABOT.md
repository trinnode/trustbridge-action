# Dependabot & Release/CI Compatibility Policy

This document describes how Dependabot (and similar automated dependency update PRs) interact with **trustbridge-action** versioning, committed `dist/` bundles, and CI workflows.

---

## Overview & Why This Matters

As a GitHub JavaScript Action, `trustbridge-action` commits its compiled distribution bundle (`dist/index.js`) to the repository so consumers can reference the action without needing to run `npm build` at execution time.

When Dependabot opens a pull request to update dependencies (e.g. bumping `@actions/core` or `node-fetch` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`), it only updates the lockfile — **it does not rebuild `dist/`**. Merging a Dependabot PR without rebuilding `dist/` results in a stale bundle that does not contain the updated dependencies or security fixes.

---

## File Maintenance Boundaries

Dependabot is configured to update NPM dependencies. Maintainers should enforce the following boundaries:

| File / Path | Dependabot Permitted | Maintainer Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json` | ✅ Yes | Review changes |
| `package-lock.json` | ✅ Yes | Review lockfile changes |
| `dist/index.js` | ❌ No (Dependabot will not modify `dist/`) | **Rebuild required** via `npm run build` |
| `action.yml` | ❌ No | Update manually if action specs change |

## Maintainer Checklist for Dependabot PRs

When reviewing and merging Dependabot PRs affecting runtime dependencies, maintainers must follow this checklist:

1. **Verify lockfile changes**: Ensure `package-lock.json` changes match `package.json`.
2. **Rebuild `dist/`**: Checkout the Dependabot branch locally, run `npm run build`, commit `dist/index.js`, and push.
3. **Verify CI**: Ensure the `CI` workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) passes.
4. **Merge PR**: Once `dist/` matches the updated dependencies and CI passes, merge the PR.

---

## Recommended Workflow Patterns

- Rebuild locally with `npm run build` and commit `dist/` on Dependabot branches before merge.
- Optional auto-build pattern: Maintainers may add a branch-protection trigger or GitHub Action that runs `npm run build` on `dependabot/*` branches and pushes the updated `dist/` back to the pull request before merging.

## GitHub Actions SHA Pinning

All third-party GitHub Actions used in `.github/workflows/` and
`docs/examples/` must be pinned to a full commit SHA, not a mutable tag such as
`@v4` or a branch such as `@main`. A full SHA fixes the exact code that runs and
keeps the workflow auditable if an upstream tag is moved or compromised.

Dependabot can still identify the tag associated with a pinned commit and open
an update PR. Keep the `github-actions` update entry in `.github/dependabot.yml`
enabled so those pins remain current.

The `workflow-security` workflow runs `actionlint` and `zizmor`, including the
`unpinned-uses` check, for changes to workflows and workflow examples. Before
merging an example, check every `uses:` line, including checkout, setup, upload,
download, script, and TrustBridge references.

If an action genuinely cannot be pinned to a SHA, document the exception next
to that `uses:` line and add a narrow, reasoned suppression in `.github/zizmor.yml`.
Never disable `unpinned-uses` for the repository as a whole.

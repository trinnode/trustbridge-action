# Troubleshooting

## No issue comment appears

Confirm the action ran on an `issues` event and the workflow permissions include `issues: write`. Workflow dispatch runs can still validate, but there may be no issue context to comment on.

## Account is reported unfunded

Horizon returns `404` for accounts that have not been activated. Send the account at least the Stellar minimum balance before adding trustlines.

## Trustline is missing

Check both the asset code and issuer. A USDC trustline for a different issuer is not considered ready.

## XLM reserve too low

The account exists but its native XLM balance is below `min_xlm_reserve`. Send additional XLM so the balance meets the configured minimum (default `1.5` XLM). Remember that each trustline also consumes base reserve.

## Horizon availability failed

Retry later or switch `horizon_url` to a trusted endpoint for the target network.

## Horizon retry wait budget exhausted

For `429`, `502`, `503`, and `504` responses, TrustBridge honors `Retry-After`
when present and stops once the configured total retry wait is exhausted. This
does not mean the account is unfunded: Horizon did not return a usable account
response. Retry later, use a healthy same-network fallback, or increase the
retry total-wait setting for a slow private mirror.

## Comment posting fails with 404 on GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

TrustBridge builds its Octokit client from `context.apiUrl` (backed by the runner's `GITHUB_API_URL`), so it should target your GHES instance automatically. A 404 or "resource not accessible" error usually means either the runner isn't actually GHES-registered (so `GITHUB_API_URL` never got set) or the token lacks `issues: write`. See [docs/USAGE.md — GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support](USAGE.md#github-enterprise-server-ghes-support) for the full verification checklist.
